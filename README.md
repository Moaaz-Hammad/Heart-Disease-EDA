# Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **Heart Disease Dataset** to uncover insights, visualize trends, and assist in predicting heart disease risk factors. The analysis aims to understand correlations and patterns within the data, which can support further machine learning applications.
